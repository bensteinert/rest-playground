= user-service

You need a running mongod on your local machine if you want to run the user-service.
You also need to change the following Spring-Boot properties, so that the service connects to your Mongo Instance

- spring.data.mongodb.host
- spring.data.mongodb.uri

After that, just execute

    ./gradle build

    java -jar ./build/libs/user-service-0.3.1.jar --server.port=8080

localhost:8080/users leads the way to the Spring Data REST world :-)

If you want to launch multiple service instances, e.g. for LoadBalancing, just use the same jar command with a different port.
