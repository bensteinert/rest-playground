= rest-client

This frontend service connects to a set of middle-tier microservices for operations on user objects.

Just execute

    gradle build
    java -jar ./build/libs/rest-client-0.2.0.jar --userService.ribbon.listOfServers=localhost:8080,localhost:8090

If you previously launched user-service instances on port 8080 and 8090.

Now you are ready to discover and play around! 

The REST-Client WebApp runs on http://localhost:8081[localhost:8081] if not specified differently.

I recommend https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhc-rest-client/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon[Chrome DHC] for accessing the REST Api!

Have fun!
