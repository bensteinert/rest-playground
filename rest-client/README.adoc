= rest-client

This frontend service connects to a set of middle-tier microservices for operations on user objects. The WebApp makes use of the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/[Spring Cloud Netflix package]

Just execute

    gradle build
    java -jar ./build/libs/rest-client-0.2.0.jar --userService.ribbon.listOfServers=localhost:8080,localhost:8090

If you previously launched user-service instances on port 8080 and 8090.

Now you are ready to discover and play around! 

The REST-Client WebApp runs on http://localhost:8081[localhost:8081] if not specified differently.

Defined endpoints are:

- GET  http://localhost:8081/api/users
- GET  http://localhost:8081/api/users/{userId}
- POST http://localhost:8081/api/users (check the required format from one of the previous GET requests)
- PUT  http://localhost:8081/api/users/{userId} (check the required format from one of the previous GET requests)
- DEL  http://localhost:8081/api/users/{userId}

I recommend https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhc-rest-client/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm[Chrome DHC] for accessing the REST Api!

Have fun!
